==========

I (Gauge) have always been driven to play competitive games. 
Knowing this, it's no surprise that i would lean that direction when 
conceptualizing a game. I have always enjoyed the Japanese RPG's for 
their fighting systems but because its all PvE and your required to 
do quests (Death to all quests!), I got burnt out on the game really fast. 
This game fixes that. It take the best parts of RPG's and gets rid of 
the hideous questing section. The game is simply fighting. A player 
will queue into a game against an opponent and battle it out to the death.
